# VisualNav


Welcome to the “Intel® Visual Guidance Suite for Student Developers & Visual Nav Plugin in Visual Studio” project, aiming to create an equitable development by evening the playing field, such that disabled developers can write code at the same productivity of their peers.  

Since existing tools do not provide enough support for those with disability, the use of visuals as a way of coding should be explored. Similar technologies include Visual Basic and Toolbox but we believe our solution is better. Our ideal end-goal is for developers with disability to work together in a live share environment at the same productivity level as their peers.

Its target users include motion input users who possess motor disability, secondary school students taking their first steps into the world of programming, teachers, developers (especially those wanting to utilize CPU threads) and for the open-source community in general.
